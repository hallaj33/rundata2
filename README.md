Revisiting running data in GLM course.

This was my final project for MA5771 (Applied Generalized Linear Models). In this project I revisited the running data I had collected from the Regression Analysis course and attempted to fit various GLMs to the data (Tweedie, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, etc).

The included report summarizes the results I found.
